# Implementation of Image Classification-MNIST Dataset Using Neural Network-With Hyperparameter Tuning.
# Project Summary
In this project, we implemented a neural network for image classification. The primary objectives included data preparation, designing a neural network architecture, training, evaluation, and reporting.

## Key Steps:
Data Preparation: We loaded the provided dataset, split it into training and testing sets, and normalized the image data to enhance convergence.

## Neural Network Architecture: 
A neural network was designed with multiple layers, including at least one hidden layer. We carefully selected activation functions for the hidden layers and the output layer, ensuring input and output dimensions matched the data and categories.

## Training: 
The neural network was trained using the training data. We employed a suitable loss function for classification, monitored training and validation accuracy to prevent overfitting, and fine-tuned hyperparameters for improved performance.

## Evaluation: 
The trained model's performance was assessed on the test set. We calculated accuracy and, if applicable, other metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Report:
A comprehensive report was compiled, summarizing our approach, challenges encountered, and the strategies employed to overcome them. Insights on the neural network's performance and noteworthy observations were included.

## Conclusion
This project exemplifies the application of neural networks in image classification, showcasing the power of deep learning techniques. Through diligent data preparation, architecture design, and rigorous training, we achieved a capable image classifier. We successfully evaluated the model's performance on a separate test set, ensuring its accuracy and reliability.

Our neural network serves as a testament to the importance of tuning hyperparameters and addressing overfitting concerns. While we encountered challenges, such as fine-tuning and optimization, the project allowed us to gain valuable experience in the field of deep learning.

This project serves as a foundation for further exploration in neural network applications and paves the way for more complex image classification tasks.
